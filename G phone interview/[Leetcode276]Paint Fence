/***
There is a fence with n posts, each post can be painted with one of the k colors.

You have to paint all the posts such that no more than two adjacent fence posts have the same color.

Return the total number of ways you can paint the fence.

Note:
n and k are non-negative integers.
***/

here can be multiple 2 adjacent posts have same colors--a more clear way to put it is "no 3 adjacent posts have the same color"

for 4 post 2 color case (0 for black, 1 for red)
0011 is a valid solution,
0001 is not

分析:   假设 n = 3, k = 3 
          前两个相同:  AA 
                     BB
                     CC
          规律: k种(将两个捆在一起，视作整体)，有3种这样的"bundle"     
          不相同:     AB/AC
                     BC/BA
                     CA/CB
               k * (k - 1)
          故两个作为一捆总共有k + k * (k - 1)种可能
          
  class Solution {
      public int numWays(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        else if (n == 1) return k;
        int diffColor = k * (k - 1), sameColor = k;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            int temp = diffColor;
            diffColor = (sameColor + diffColor) * (k - 1);
            sameColor = temp;
        }
        return diffColor + sameColor;
    }
  }
