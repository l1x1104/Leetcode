    1) Orientation
       Orientation of an ordered triplet of points in the plane can be: clockwise, counterclockwise and colinear
       
       Two segments (p1,q1) and (p2,q2) intersect if and only if one of the following two condition is verified:
       1) General Case:
          - (p1,q1,p2)和(p1,q1,q2) have different orientations and
          - (p2,q2,p1)和(p2,q2,p2) have different orientations
       2) Special Case 
          - (p1, q1, p2), (p1, q1, q2), (p2, q2, p1), and (p2, q2, q1) are all collinear and the x-projections of (p1, q1) and 
          - (p2, q2) intersect the y-projections of (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect
