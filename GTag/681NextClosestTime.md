```
Given a time represented in the format "HH:MM", form the next closest time by reusing the current digits. There is no limit on how many times a digit can be reused.

You may assume the given input string is always valid. For example, "01:34", "12:09" are all valid. "1:34", "12:9" are all invalid.

Example 1:

Input: "19:34"
Output: "19:39"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 1, 9, 3, 4, is 19:39, which occurs 5 minutes later.  It is not 19:33, because this occurs 23 hours and 59 minutes later.
Example 2:

Input: "23:59"
Output: "22:22"
Explanation: The next closest time choosing from digits 2, 3, 5, 9, is 22:22. It may be assumed that the retu

class Solution {
    static int[] mins = { 600, 60, 10, 1 };
    public String nextClosestTime(String time) {
        int colon = time.indexOf(':');
        int cur = Integer.valueOf(time.substring(0, colon)) * 60 + Integer.valueOf(time.substring(colon + 1));
        char[] next = new char[4];
        for (int i = 1, d = 0; i <= 1440 && d < 4; i++) {
            int m = (cur + i) % 1440;
            for (d = 0; d < 4; d++) {
                next[d] = (char)('0' + m / mins[d]); 
                m %= mins[d];
                if (time.indexOf(next[d]) == -1) break;
            }
        }
        return new String(next, 0, 2) + ':' + new String(next, 2, 2);
    }
}
