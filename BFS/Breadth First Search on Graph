1. Algorithm

BFS can be done in undirected graph as well, with absolute no change in the algorithm.

※The only difference in the process is: 
since every edge is undirected, it would be considered for twice, once for each endpoint.

The main purpose of numbering is  which order to go the vertices in the pool advance the next pool. The sequence number
would be deal out in FIFO fashion. The FIFO mechanism can be forced using a queue in stead of numbers.

In undirected graph, "restart"(在有向图中，从任意某一个起点开始很可能不能走完所有的vertices,选择没有visited的restart) only happen if the 
graph is disconnected.

※ Time complexity? depends on what operations during running time.
  Two things repeatedly:  1. visits Vertex 
                          2. from every Vertex checks to see if the neighboors have been visited or not
                          We count each one unit of time.
  Directed: O(n+e)    \
                       |-> They both converted to running time O(n+e)   
  Undirected: O(n+2e) /
