If the depth of a tree is smaller than 5, then this tree can be represented by a list of three-digits integers.

For each integer in this list:
The hundreds digit represents the depth D of this node, 1 <= D <= 4.
The tens digit represents the position P of this node in the level it belongs to, 1 <= P <= 8. The position is the same as that
in a full binary tree.
The units digit represents the value V of this node, 0 <= V <= 9.
Given a list of ascending three-digits integers representing a binary with the depth smaller than 5. You need to return the sum 
of all paths from the root towards the leaves.

Example 1:
Input: [113, 215, 221]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The tree that the list represents is:
    3
   / \
  5   1

The path sum is (3 + 5) + (3 + 1) = 12.
Example 2:
Input: [113, 221]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The tree that the list represents is: 
    3
     \
      1

The path sum is (3 + 1) = 4.
class Solution {
    private int sum = 0;
    public int pathSum(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i: nums) {
            int key = i / 10;
            int value = i % 10;
            map.put(key, value);
        }
        helper(nums[0] / 10, 0, map);
        return sum;
    }
    private void helper(int root, int sums, Map<Integer, Integer> map) {
        int level = root / 10, pos = root % 10;
        int left = (level + 1) * 10 + pos * 2 - 1;
        int right = (level + 1) * 10 + pos * 2;
        int curr = sums + map.get(root);
        if(!map.containsKey(left) && !map.containsKey(right)) {
            sum += curr;
            return ;
        }
        if(map.containsKey(left)) helper(left, curr, map);
        if(map.containsKey(right)) helper(right, curr, map);
    }
 }
